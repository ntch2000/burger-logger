# Burger Logger

## Description

This project showcases the Model, View, and Controller (MVC) design for a burger resturant application. This application allows users to input the type of burger they want to eat and then press a button to "devour" that burger.

The application utilizes Node.js and MySQL to query and route data between the database and application, and Handlebars to generate the HTML front-end.
